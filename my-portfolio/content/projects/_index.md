# My ASE projects

Here are the two ASE230 projects I worked on during this semester.

---
## Project 1 

Project 1 is a REST Api server using php and mysql. 
It also inludes deployment with nginx and Token security. 
It uses CRUD operations, Bearer tokens, and is documented with markdown.

### Endpoints
The endpoints are: 
'GET /users' Get all users
'GET /users/{id}' => Get user by id
'POST /users' => 'Create new user',
'PUT /users/{id}' => 'Update all user information',
'DELETE /users{id}' => 'Delete user',
'GET /users/pastpurchase' => 'Get users by pastpurchases',
'DELETE /users/name' => 'Delete by name',
'DELETE /users/pastpurchase' => 'Delete by pastpurchases'

---

 Used same api's as project 1
 Deployed using Docker
